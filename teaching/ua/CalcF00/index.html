<H3>Course Information and Policies:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Attendance:</B> Students are expected to attend every
       scheduled class, and to be familiar with the University Class
       Attendance policy as it appears in the General Catalog.  It is
       the student's responsibility to keep informed of any
       announcements, syllabus adjustments or policy changes made
       during scheduled classes.  Students who are excessively 
       absent may be "administratively dropped" from the course to
       make room for other students trying to get in. "Excessively"
       means 2 days in a row or any 4 days during the semester. 
<p>
   <li> <b>Text:</b> "Calculus (2nd Edition)" by Hughes Hallet,
      Gleason, et. al. Wiley: 1998.
  <li> <b>Calculators:</b> Every student must have (and know how to
      use!) a programmable graphing calculator.  Calculators
      <em>will</em> be allowed on exams, but no calculator swapping is
      permitted. 
<p>
  <LI><B>Exams:</B> There will be three tests and a final
      exam.  The tests are scheduled for <b>Monday, Sept. 11</b>,
      <b>Wednesday, Oct. 11</b>, and <b>Friday, Nov. 3</b>.
      The University has scheduled the final exam for <b>Friday,
      Dec. 8 from 5:00 - 7:00</b>.  Each exam is worth 100 points and
      the final exam is worth 200 points.</br>
      Exams cannot be given at any other time.  If, for whatever
      reason, a test is missed, the score for that test will be
      replaced with the score on the corresponding part of the final 
      exam.  A second missed test, or a missed final exam, will result
      in a score of 0.
  <li><b>Homework:</b> Homework, an essential
      component of the course, will be assigned and collected
      regularly.  Selected problems  will be graded and a
      final score equivalent to one test, 100 points, will be
      assigned.<br>
      For full credit, homework must be turned in at the beginning of
      class on the day 
      it is due.  Late homework will be accepted for grading until the
      beginning of the next class meeting, but will earn only 50%
      credit.  Homework turned in later may be graded but will earn no
      points.  The lowest 2 homework scores will be thrown out before
      calculating the final homework score.
   <LI><B>Quizes:</B> There may be occasional,
      unannounced quizes on basic material.  Points for these quizes
      are "bonus" points, counted above and beyond the points for
      other course work.  Coming to class and taking these quizes
      is thus always to the student's advantage.
<p>
   <li><b>Grades:</b> The total number of points possible on
tests and homework is 600. Grades will be based on the percentage of
       points earned, and will be no lower than those set forth in the
       following table:
       <p>
<center><table border=1 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5> 
<tr>  <th>Points</th><th>Percentage</th><th>Grade</th></tr>
<tr>  <td>540-600</td><td>90% to 100%</td><td>A</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>480-539</td><td>80% to 90%</td><td>B</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>420-479</td><td>70% to 80%</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>360-419</td><td>60% to 70%</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>0-359</td><td>0% to 60%</td><td>E</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
   <li><b>W's and I's:</b> Students withdrawing from the course before
       October 13 will receive the grade W if they are passing at the
       time.  Students will be considered to be passing at the time of
       withdraw if they have scored at least 50% on the work completed
       at that time.<br>
       The grade of I will be awarded only if <u>all</u> the following
       conditions are met:
       <ol>
	 <li>The student has completed all but a small portion of the
             required work. 
	 <li>The student has scored at least 50% on the work completed.
	 <li>The student has a valid reason for not completing the course
	     on time.
	 <li>The student agrees to make up the material in a short period
             of time.
	 <li>The student asks for the incomplete before 
             the final exam.
