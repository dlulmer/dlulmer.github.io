One sample z and t procedures for means:
    Assumptions and caveats
    Confidence intervals
	Procedures
	How interval varies with confidence level, sample size, std dev
	Finding sample size for a given margin of error, conf level, std dev
    Significance tests (one and two-sided)
	Procedures
        Reasoning and vocabulary of significance tests
        Using them.  E.g., choosing appropriate significance levels
	Practical vs statistical significance
    Relationship between significance tests and confidence intervals
    When to use z vs when to use t

Matched pair procedures
Two sample procedures (with two options for df)

All of the above for proportions

The problem of multiple comparisons

Inference for 2-way tables:
    counts, expected counts, the chi-squared statistic, df
    Assumption for the chi-squared test
    Use of the chi-squared test
