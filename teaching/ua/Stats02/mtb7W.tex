\begin {enumerate}

\item  The waiting time for the next available station at a particular
computer lab is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 15].

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Use the {\bf Calc $>$ Random Data $>$ Uniform} menu command to 
simulate the waiting times for 500 students.

\item  Create a histogram of the simulated waiting times, and
briefly describe the shape of the distribution.

\item  What is the average of the simulated waiting times?
How close is it to 7.5 minutes?

\item  What percent of the simulated waiting times are less
than 7.5 minutes?  How close is it to 50\%.

\end{enumerate}


\item  The yearly rainfall total for a city in northern California
is normally distributed with mean 18 inches and standard deviation
6 inches.

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Use the {\bf Calc $>$ Probability Distributions $>$ Normal} menu 
command to find the probability that the total rainfall for a randomly 
selected year is less than 10 inches.  (Hint:  Use the 
Cumulative Probability Function.)

\item  Use the {\bf Calc $>$ Probability Distributions $>$ Normal} menu 
command to find the probability that the total rainfall for a randomly 
selected year is greater than 30 inches.  (Hint:  Use the 
Cumulative Probability Function.)

\item  Use the {\bf Calc $>$ Probability Distributions $>$ Normal} menu 
command to find the probability that the total rainfall for a randomly 
selected year is between 10 inches and 30 inches.  (Hint:  Use the 
Cumulative Probability Function.)

\item  Use the {\bf Calc $>$ Probability Distributions $>$ Normal} menu 
command to find the third quartile of the distribution of the yearly 
rainfall total for this city.  (Hint:  Use the Inverse Probability 
Function.)
