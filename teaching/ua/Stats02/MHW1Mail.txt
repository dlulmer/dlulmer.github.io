Dear students,

It turns out that the person who wrote this assignment was not very careful
and so you need more information than is given to do part 4 of the Unix
version.   Because of this, I am making this assignment due Wednesday,
September 4.  

Also, if you are doing the Unix version, you have 2 options: (i) omit part of
4 of the Unix version; or (ii) do part 4, using the hints below, and get up to
2 extra points (of 10).

The problem is that inserting alphanumeric data (letters) is somewhat tricky. 
Here is part of a minitab session that adds the required data:


 
 MTB > insert c1;
 SUBC> format (a50).
 DATA> The Basic Practice of Statistics, 2/E
 DATA> END
 MTB > insert c2;
 SUBC> format (a25).
 DATA> Moore
 DATA> END
 MTB > insert c3
 DATA> 77.75
 DATA> end
 MTB > print c1-c3

The point is that to add alphanumeric data, you need the "FORMAT" subcommand
of insert.  The line 
         format (a50).
tells minitab that you want to enter up to 50 characters.  Note
carefully the periods and semicolons, they are essential!

Good luck,

Doug Ulmer
