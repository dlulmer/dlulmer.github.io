Karl Eller, Arizona business leader and nationally recognized
entrepreneur, will be inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame by
the American Advertising Federation (AAF) on Tuesday in New York City.

Eller, who said he is "honored and humbled to bring this award home to
Arizona" is the first Arizonan and second outdoor advertising
executive to be elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame.

AAF cited Eller's leadership, especially in outdoor advertising, where
he "reshaped the business of outdoor advertising and transformed it
into a business powerhouse," and also credited his business
innovations and "limitless volunteerism."
