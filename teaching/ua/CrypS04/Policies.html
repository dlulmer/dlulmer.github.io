It is widelyemployed in commercial, military, diplomatic, and internetapplications.  This course is an introduction the mathematicalaspects of cryptography.<h2>Contact Information:</h2><ul>  <li><b>Professor:</b> Douglas Ulmer, Professor of Mathematics  <ul>  	<li><b>Office:</b> Math 204  	<li><b>Phone:</b> 621-6861  	<li><b>E-mail:</b> <a href="mailto:ulmer@math.arizona.edu">ulmer@math.arizona.edu</a>  	<li><b>Office hours:</b> 2-3 Mondays, 4-4:30 Mondays and Fridays in Math 204.  1-2 Fridays in Math East 145.  (These may change---check <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~ulmer">Professor Ulmer's home page</a> for the latest office hours.)  </ul>  <li><b>Assistant:</b> Cetin Urtis, Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics  <ul>  	<li><b>Office:</b> Math 305  	<li><b>Phone:</b> 621-9991    <li><b>E-mail:</b> <a href="mailto:ulmer@math.arizona.edu">urtis@math.arizona.edu</a>    <li><b>Office hours:</b> 12-1 Mondays, 3-4 Tuesdays, 10-11 Wednesdays in Math 305.    (These may change---check <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~urtis/">Dr. Urtis' home page</a> for the latest office hours.)  </ul>  <li><b>Course Homepage:</b> http://math.arizona.edu/~ulmer/teaching/CrypS04/index.html </ul>  <H2>Course Policies:</H2><UL>   <LI><B>Attendance:</B> Students are expected to attend every       scheduled class, and to be familiar with the University Class       Attendance policy as it appears in the General Catalog.  It is       the student's responsibility to keep informed of any       announcements, syllabus adjustments or policy changes made       during scheduled classes.  Students who are excessively        absent may be "administratively dropped" from the course. "Excessively"       means 2 days in a row or any 3 days during the semester.   <li><b>Homework:</b> Homework is an essential      component of the course and will be assigned and collected      regularly, approximately weekly.        For full credit, homework must be turned in at the beginning of      class on the day       it is due.  Late homework will be accepted for grading until the      beginning of the next class meeting, but will earn only 70%      credit.  Homework turned in later <i>may</i> be graded but will earn no      points.  The single lowest homework score will be thrown out before      calculating the final homework score.  <LI><B>Project:</b> Each student will complete a required project, which       may entail analyzing a cryptosystem      or decrypting an encrypted message using tools discussed in      class, implementing some interesting cryptogrpahic protocol or tool,        or writing an expository paper about an issue of current cryptographic       interest.  More details will be provided later.    <LI><B>Exams:</B> There will be one in-class exam  during the first half of the semester and a final      exam.    <LI><B>Dates:</b> The test is      tentatively scheduled for <b>March 3</b>.        The project will be due approximately      <b>April 23</b>, and the University has scheduled the final exam for      <b>May 7 from 2:00 - 4:00 in Modern Languages 314</b>.  The dates of the exam      and project may change but the date of the final exam will      definitely not change.  Exams cannot be given at any other time.      If a test or project is missed for a valid reason, the score for      that test will be replaced with the score on the corresponding      part of the final exam.  (The meanings of "valid" and      "corresponding part" will be determined by the instructor.) A      second missed test or project, or a missed final exam, will      result in a score of 0.  There will be no exceptions to this      policy.   <li><b>Grades:</b> Course grades will be determined by scores on   exams, projects, and homework, with weights as follows: Homework,   25%, midterm exam 20%, project 20%, final exam 35%.  Grades will be   based on the percentage of possible       points earned, and will be no lower than these: 90-100%: A,       80%-90%: B, 70%-80%: C, 60%-70%: D, below 60%: E.   <li><b>W's and I's:</b> Students withdrawing from the course before       March 9 will receive the grade W if they are passing at the       time.  Students will be considered to be passing at the time of       withdraw if they have scored at least 50% on the work completed       at that time.<br>       The grade of I will be awarded only if <u>all</u> of these       conditions are met:       <ol>	 <li>The student has completed all but a small portion of the             required work. 	 <li>The student has scored at least 50% on the work completed.	 <li>The student has a valid reason for not completing the course	     on time.	 <li>The student agrees to make up the material in a short period             of time.	 <li>The student asks for the incomplete before              the final exam.       </ol></UL><h2>Syllabus</h2><ul>   <li><b>Text:</b> "Introduction to Cryptography" by W. Trappe and   L. Washington (required).  We will cover Chapters 1-7, 14, 17, and    a selection from 8-13 (not in that order).  <li> <b>Software:</b> Many homework assignments will involve tasks,   such as manipulating large numbers, that are only reasonable to do   with a computer.  Thus students will need to have access to a computer   and a suitable software package.  The following packages are highly   recommended: Mathematica, Maple, Matlab.  Mathematica and Matlab are   available to users of the University u-system.   Matlab is available   on open access computers in several labs, including the information   commons area of the main library.  Student versions of all three packages   are available at CATS for about $125.  <i>Students are responsible for   getting access to and learning to use a suitable package.</i>    Instructions in the appendices to the Trappe-Washington text should   be enough to get you started in Mathematica, Maple, or Matlab.   <li><b>Topics:</b>  <table align="center" cellspacing="5">	<tr><th>Dates</th><th>Topic</th></tr>	<tr><td>1/14 - 1/30</td><td>Basic framework and examples (TW Chapters 1-2)</td>	<tr><td>2/2 - 2/6</td><td>Number Theory I (TW 3.1-3.4, 3.10)</td>	<tr><td>2/9 - 2/20</td><td>Symmetric Key Cryptography (TW Chapters 4-5)</td>	<tr><td>2/23 - 2/27</td><td>Information Theory (TW Chapter 14)</td>	<tr><td>3/1 - 3/5</td><td>Review and Midterm</td>	<tr><td>3/8 - 3/12</td><td>Number Theory II (TW 3.5 - 3.9)</td>	<tr><td>3/22 - 4/2</td><td>Public Key Cryptography (TW Chapters 6-7)</td>	<tr><td>4/5 - 4/9</td><td>Quantum Computing (TW Chapter 17)</td>	<tr><td>4/12 - 5/5</td><td>Selected Applications (TW Chapters 8, 13, and parts of 9-12)</td></table></ul></body></html>
