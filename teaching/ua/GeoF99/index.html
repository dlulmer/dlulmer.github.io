<H3>Texts:</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Massey, "A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology", Springer 1991.
(Required) 
<LI> Singer and Thorpe, "Lecture Notes on Elementary Topology and
Geometry", Springer 1967.  (Recommended)
</UL>

<H3>Syllabus:</H3>
<UL>
<LI> The main part of the course will be foundational material on the
fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology theory.
(Roughly Chapters 1-12 of Massey.)
<LI> The first two weeks of the course will be a quick review/outline
of the basics of point set topology.  (Roughly the first 2 chapters of
Singer and Thorpe.)
</UL>

<H3>Course Requirements:</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Regular Attendance!
<LI> Weekly homework assignments
<LI> One mid-term exam (in class).  Date to be announced.
<LI> A final exam on Thursday, December 16, 8-10am, in Math 501.
</UL>

<H3>Grades:</H3>

Grades will be determined on a point system with the following weights:
<UL>
<LI> Homework: 40%
<LI> Midterm: 20%
<LI> Final Exam: 40%
</UL>
The grading scale is:
<UL>
<LI>A: 90-100%
<LI>B: 80-89%
<LI>C: 70-79%
<LI>D: 60-69%
<LI>E: 0-59%
</UL>


<H3>Missed exams, etc.:</H3>

The grade for an exam missed for good cause, and with advance notice,

exam.  An exam missed without advance notice and good cause will
receive a score of 0.
<P>
If you withdraw between the 4th and 8th week of class, you will receive
a grade of "W".  Withdrawing after the 8th week of class is possible
only under the most exceptional circumstances.

<H3>Administrative drop:</H3>
Students who are excessively absent (i.e., absent for 2 consecutive
classes, or for 4 classes throughout the term) will be administratively
dropped.

<H3>Other resources:</H3>

Jai-Ling Dai is a senior graduate student who will be a TA for this
course.  She plans to run a weekly discussion session to go over
homework problems and answer questions.
