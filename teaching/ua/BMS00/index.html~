<H3>Additional Course Policies:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Exams:</B> Midterm exams are scheduled for Monday, March 6 and
Friday, April 21, in class.  The final exam will be Friday, May 5,
2-4pm in MTL124.  Exams cannot be given at any other time.  If, for
whatever reason, one midterm is missed, the grade for that midterm
will be replaced with the grade on the corresponding part of the final
exam.  A second missed midterm, or a missed final exam, will result in
a grade of 0.  
<LI><B>Quizes:</B> There will be occasional,
unannounced quizes on basic material.  Points for these quizes are
"bonus" points, counted above and beyond the 800 points for other
course work.  Coming to class and taking these quizes is thus always
to the student's advantage.  
<LI><B>Late Homework:</B> Late homework
is unfair to the people who do their work on time, and it creates a
lot of extra work for everyone.  To discourage it, the following
policy is in effect: Homework will be accepted up to one week late,
but each day of delay will result in a 20% reduction in the score.
For example, a paper due on Friday and done perfectly would receive a
score of 80% if turned in on the following Monday, 60% on Tuesday, and
so on.  "On Monday" means in my office or in my departmental mailbox
(handed in at the window in Room 108) by 5pm.  
<LI><B>Administrative
drops:</B> Students who are excessively absent may be
"administratively dropped" from the course to make room for 
other students trying to get in. "Excessively" means 2 days in a row
or any 4 days during the semester.
