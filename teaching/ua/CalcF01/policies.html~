<H3>Course Policies:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Attendance:</B> Students are expected to attend every
       scheduled class, and to be familiar with the University Class
       Attendance policy as it appears in the General Catalog.  It is
       the student's responsibility to keep informed of any
       announcements, syllabus adjustments or policy changes made
       during scheduled classes.  Students who are excessively 
       absent may be "administratively dropped" from the course to
       make room for other students trying to get in. "Excessively"
       means 2 days in a row or any 4 days during the semester. 
   <li> <b>Text:</b> "Calculus (3rd Edition)" by Hughes Hallet,
      Gleason, et. al. Wiley: 2002.
  <li> <b>Calculators:</b> Every student must have a
      calculator which can graph functions, zoom in on graphs, and
      trace the curve. Any graphing calculator from TI, HP, or Casio
      should be fine for this course.  (If you are not sure, ask me.)
      If you plan to continue on to
      Math 129, you probably want a programmable calculator.
      Obviously you will also need to learn how to use whatever
      calculator you buy.  Calculators
      <em>will</em> be allowed and needed on exams, but no calculator
      swapping is permitted. 
  <LI><B>Exams:</B> There will be three tests and a final
      exam.  The tests are scheduled for <b>Wednesday, Sept. 12</b>,
      <strike>Monday, Oct. 22</strike>, <b>Wednesday, Oct. 31</b>, and
      <strike>Wednesday, Nov. 28</strike> <b>Monday, Dec.10</b>.  
      The University has scheduled the final exam for <b>Monday,
      Dec. 10 from 2:00 - 4:00 in Econ 405</b>.  This date will definitely not
      change.  Each exam is worth 100 points and
      the final exam is worth 200 points.</br>
      Exams cannot be given at any other time.  If a test is missed,
      for a valid reason, the score for that test will be
      replaced with the score on the corresponding part of the final 
      exam.  A second missed test, or a missed final exam, will result
      in a score of 0.  There will be no exceptions to this policy.
  <li><b>Homework:</b> Homework is an essential
      component of the course and will be assigned and collected
      regularly.  Selected problems  will be graded and a
      final score equivalent to one test, 100 points, will be
      assigned.<br>
      For full credit, homework must be turned in at the beginning of
      class on the day 
      it is due.  Late homework will be accepted for grading until the
      beginning of the next class meeting, but will earn only 80%
      credit.  Homework turned in later may be graded but will earn no
      points.  The lowest 2 homework scores will be thrown out before
      calculating the final homework score.<br>
      Your book has two types of homework problems, ``exercises'' and
      ``problems.''  Exercises are routine and are meant to test basic
      understanding of the material; you should try all of them after
      reading the section and ask in class about any you can't do.
      Problems are more conceptual and often harder.  Problems are what
      you will write up and turn in.      
   <LI><B>Quizes:</B> There may be occasional,
      unannounced quizes on basic material.  Points for these quizes
      are "bonus" points, counted above and beyond the points for
      other course work.  Coming to class and taking these quizes
      is thus always to the student's advantage.  Quiz questions tend
      to bear a remarkable resemblance to ``exercises.''
   <li><b>Grades:</b> The total number of points possible on
       tests and homework is 600. Grades will be based on the percentage of
       points earned, and will be no lower than these: 90-100%: A,
       80%-90%: B, 70%-80%: C, 60%-70%: D, below 60%: E.
   <li><b>W's and I's:</b> Students withdrawing from the course before
       October 12 will receive the grade W if they are passing at the
       time.  Students will be considered to be passing at the time of
       withdraw if they have scored at least 50% on the work completed
       at that time.<br>
       The grade of I will be awarded only if <u>all</u> of these
       conditions are met:
       <ol>
	 <li>The student has completed all but a small portion of the
             required work. 
	 <li>The student has scored at least 50% on the work completed.
	 <li>The student has a valid reason for not completing the course
	     on time.
	 <li>The student agrees to make up the material in a short period
             of time.
	 <li>The student asks for the incomplete before 
             the final exam.
       </ol>

<H3>Hints for success:</H3>

   <LI><B>Understanding:</B> Understanding calculus means being
       able to apply it in new situations.  Students sometimes say
       ``I understood everything, but I just couldn't do this exam
       problem.''  What's really true is that such a student may have
       studied calculus in a passive way, but not actively.  Active
       learning means constantly asking questions like ``what happens
       if I change this part,'' ``can I think of another example like
       this one, or one that's slightly different,'' or ``what does this
       say about the
       physical world, and does it agree with my experience?'' 
       If your personal goal is to understand
       <i>actively</i> the material, and you put some effort into it,
       you will do well.
   <li><b>The final exam</b> is a common final for all sections of the
       exam.  No one teaching the course, including me, will know
       what the questions are until the exam starts. This means there
       is no way for me to teach you how to do just the problems
       that will be on the exam. Your job is to learn principles and
       techniques that will allow you to do lots of kinds of problems,
       including the ones on the final.  My job is to help you with
       this, and I will do everything I can.  When the dust settles,
       how actively you understand calculus is going to be the
       determining factor.
   <li><b>This section</b> will definitely not be the easiest one.  I
       tend to (try to) make my students work hard and they tend to do
       well on the common final, with correspondingly good grades.  If
       you want an easy course, (and a dicier chance on the final),
       another section may be a better bet.
   <li><b>Obvious stuff</b> that's worth saying anyway:
       <ul>
	 <li>Show up for class.
	 <li>Keep up with the work.
	 <li>Ask questions in class.
	 <li>Go to office hours and ask questions.
	 <li>Work with a few other people in class and ask them
	     questions.  Try to answer their questions.
	 <li>Devote your energy to learning calculus, not to worrying
	     about grades.
