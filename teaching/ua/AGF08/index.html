Modest effort should allow the student to get an idea of the main problems and techniques in the subject.  More vigorous effort should prepare the student to work with the many faculty members in the department working in number theory and algebraic geometry.  We will start from the very beginning, but go rather quickly over the basic foundations.</p><h2>Policies:</h2><ul>	<li><b>Class meetings:</b> TTh 12:30 - 1:45 in Math 102.  The course will mostly be in the traditional lecture format, occasionally supplemented by student presentations of homework solutions.  If there is demand, a discussion hour may be added.</li>	<li><b>Texts:</b> For the fall semester, Shafarevitch's "Basic Algebraic Geometry1" is recommended.  Later in the course other notes may be distributed.  </li>	<li><b>Prerequisites:</b> The PhD core courses in Algebra and Geometry-Topology.  Further exposure to geometry and commutative algebra will be useful but is not required.</li>	<li><b>Homework:</b> A large number of exercises will be posed and, if written up, will be read and commented on.</li>	<li><b>Project:</b> There will be a required final project in which students will master an additional topic and write a short expository paper on it, suitable for fellow students.</li>    <li><b>Grades:</b> Grades will be based on homework (65%) and the project (35%).</li>	<li><b>Other policies:</b> Please read my <a href="../StandardPolicies.html">standard policies</a> about other matters.</li></ul><h2>Contact Information:</h2>  <ul>	<li><b>Instructor:</b> Douglas Ulmer  	<li><b>Office:</b> Math 204  	<li><b>Phone:</b> 621-6861  	<li><b>E-mail:</b> <a href="mailto:ulmer@math.arizona.edu">ulmer@math.arizona.edu</a>  	<li><b>Office hours:</b> Starting 9/2: T 3-4 in Math 204, Th 2-3 in Math 220.
